# Overview 
In this project, I developed a game called "Alligator Game" with the aim of furthering my learning as a computer engineer. This game is similar to the classic Snake Game, where the player contols an alligator to collect food and grow in size while avoiding collisions with the game boundaries and the alligator's own body.

## How to Play
1. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the alligator's movement.
2. Collect the yellow food items that appear on the screen to increase your score and length of the alligator.
3. Avoid collisions with the game window boundaries and the alligaotrs's body. If you collide with any of these, the game ends.

## Purpose
The main purpose of developing this software was to:
* Enhance my skills in game development using the pygame library and Python
* Gain experience in implementing game mechanics like player control, collision detection, and scoring
* Learn about audio integration in games by adding sound effects and background music

## Software Demo Video
If you would like to see a demonstration video and a walkthrough of the code, please check out the following YouTube video:

# Development Environment
During the development of this program, I sued the following tools and technologies:
* IDE: I used Visual Studio Code for coding, testing, and running the game
* Python: The game was developed using the Python programming language
* Pygame: I utilized the pygame library, a well-known Python library for game development, to handle graphics, audio, and user input

# Useful Websites
The following websites were helpful during the project:

* [Pygame Documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/): This documentation site also assisted with some syntax corrections
* [YouTube - Pygame Tutorials by Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6xMBig-pP4&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lp3jAExUCewBfMx3UZFkh5): Tech With Tim's pygame tutorials were a great resource for learning the basics that come in the pygame library
* [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/): This webite helped provide great sound effects that are implemented into the game, especially the main game sound which was produced by humanoide9000

# Future Work
In the future, I have though about changing certain features and adding in the following areas:

* Implement more challenging levels or game modes for the players
* Add a high-score tracker to encourage competetion
* Improve the game's graphics and user interface for a better experience
